Task:
Identify and return only the database tables necessary for generating a correct SQL query based on the given database schema.

Database Schema:
- users: The users table stores individual records with unique email addresses, containing name and creation date attributes, linked by a primary key id.
- products: A database table containing product information with a unique identifier and attributes for name and price.
- orders: Table "orders" stores information about user transactions, linking users to order details, and tracking status and creation timestamps.
- order_items: Orders have associated items, defined by product ID and quantity, referencing orders and products tables.

Query:
{query}

Expected output example
{{
    "identified_tables": ["table1", "table2"]
}}
